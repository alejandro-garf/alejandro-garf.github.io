### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was one of my favorite labs for multiple reasons. One of them being that I have alwsays loved to play Blackjack with my friends so being able to write a program relating to it was extremely gratifying. It was also one of the first times that I wrote functions so even though it was challenging, it has opened the doors for me to be able to do much more with programming in the future.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3 part one was a very fun lab for me and made me realize that I was happy with my major choice. It was a very simple lab looking back at it but at the time I felt like I was really doing something impressive. More importantly however, I was writing a very importat and neccessary program for the good of the world. A program that calculated the average unit price of a Pizza. I love pizza so writing a program that was directly correlated to a real world interest was a lot of fun.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9 part one was one of my most memorable and favorite simply because of how much time I spent trying to figure it out. It was not an easy lab by any means but once it clicked, it was very gratifying. Mostly because I can definetly see how this is very neccessary for all types of different programs. There was just something really cool about reading text from a different file and knowing that I was able to make my computer do that.
